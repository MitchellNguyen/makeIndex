# makeIndex
Prompt: Write a Python function, createIndex, that takes one String argument that is the name of a file. It should read the contents of the file, and print a sorted (in ASCII order) index of the words, one per line, where each word is followed by the sequence of line numbers (sorted numerically, separated by comma) that tell where that word occurs. If the same word appears on more than once on the same line, the corresponding number should appear only once.
